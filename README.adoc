== Releases and IM Versions

In order to signal and avoid breaking changes introduced by a number of JIRA issues and the restructure of this repository, 
the upcoming release for this repository is going to be tagged as **Release-2.0.0**.
Simultaneously, the internal namespace used in the schemas is also changed to `http://schemas.openehr.org/v2`.
 
The repository is structured as follows:
